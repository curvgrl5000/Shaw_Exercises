# Extra Credit
# Read about ordinal and cardinal numbers online.
# In mathematics, cardinal numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number â€“ the number of elements in the set. The transfinite cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets.

# With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why this really is # 2011? (Hint, you can't pick years at random.)
 
 
# Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
# Use Ruby to check your answers to this as well.
