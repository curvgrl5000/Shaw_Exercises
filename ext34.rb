# Exercise 34: ACCESSING ELEMENTS OF ARRAYS 
# Arrays are pretty useful, but unless you can get at the things in them they aren't all that great. You can already go through the elements of a list in order, but what if you want say, the 5th element? You need to know how to access the elements of an array. Here's how you would access the first element of an array:


animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock',
'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

bear = animals[0]; puts bear
puts animals[0]
puts animals[0 + 3]
puts animals[1]
puts animals[2]
puts animals[3]
puts animals[4]
puts animals[5]
puts animals[6]

puts animals.first
puts animals.last
puts animals.sort
puts animals.length  
puts #blank  
puts ":::\\:::\\" *10
puts #blank

# Extra Credit
# Read about ordinal and cardinal numbers online.
# In mathematics, cardinal numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number â€“ the number of elements in the set. The transfinite cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets.

# With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why this really is # 2011? (Hint, you can't pick years at random.)
 
 
# Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
# Use Ruby to check your answers to this as well.

snacks = ['popcorn', 'seeds', 'cookies', 'nuts', 'm&ms', 'protein-bars', 'carrot sticks']
puts "A great list of snacks to eat:"
puts snacks [0]
puts snacks [1]
puts snacks [2]
puts snacks [3]
puts snacks [4]
puts snacks [5] 
puts snacks [6]   
puts snacks [7] = 'trail mix'
puts snacks [8] = ['oranges', 'apples', 'pears']   
puts #blank

def prompt
  print "Type it out: "
end

snacks.delete(snacks[8])
snacks.each do |s| 
  puts 'I love ' + s + '!' 
end
puts #blank
puts "What's missing?"  
prompt; new_snack = gets.chomp()  
puts #blank
puts "Okay added to our list:"
puts [snacks, new_snack]
