# Exercise 30: ELSE AND IF  
# 'if' expressions are used for conditional execution. The values false and nil are false, and everything else is true. Notice Ruby uses elsif, not else if nor elif. 

# 'if' is a modifier, and executes code if the conditional is true. There's other statements including: 'unless' which creates an interesting scenario; whereby the value of true or false is used to initialize the branch of code to be executed.

# An 'if' expression's conditional is separated from code by the reserved word 'then', a newline, or a semicolon. The follolwing program uses: 'if', 'elsif','else' and I threw in 'unless' just for fun! 

# The people, cars and buses
# EXAMPLE NO.1
people = 30
cars = 40
buses = 15

if cars > people
  puts "We should take the cars."
 elsif cars < people
   puts "We should not take the cars."
 else
   puts "We can't decide."
 end

# Try some more complex boolean expressions like cars > people and buses < cars. Above each line write an English description of what the line does.      
 
 if buses > cars
   puts "That's too many buses."
 elsif buses < cars
   puts "Maybe we could take a bus."
 else
   puts "We still can't decide."
 end
 
 if people > buses
   puts "Alright, let's just take the bus."
 else
   puts "Fine, let's stay home then."

# Extra Credit
# Remember what an 'if' statment does:
# An if statement creates what is called a "branch" in the code. It's kind of like those choose your own adventure books where you are asked to turn to one page if you make one choice, and another if you go a different direction. The if-statement tells your script, "If this boolean expression is True, then run the code under it, otherwise skip it."

# Try to guess what 'elsif' and 'else' are doing.
# else: The keyword 'else' leads to a path for a program to resume if the conditions for an if statement weren't met. An else statement must come after an if statement. Or else, what would the else be an alternative to? 

# elsif: This indicates an alternative to the preceding if â€“ and any other preceding elsif statements. So, you start off with the if, have any number of elsif alternatives, and end with an else to capture all the leftover possibilities. In other languages, elsif is spelled out as: else if


# EXAMPLE NO.2  - Here I'm creating a class Dog, then playing around with methods inside the class, on line 68 I begin to create the logic using if and else....

class Dog  
  def initialize(breed, name)  
    # Instance variables  
    @breed = breed  
    @name = name
  end
  # a method called display using the instance methods 
  def display
    puts "I'm a #{@breed}, and my name is #{@name}."
  end
end

# d is created with the 'new' method as a 'Dog' class, and we're passing the 2 values back to parameters in the array of the class.
d = Dog.new('Chihuahau', 'Elizabeth The Great')
d.display

doggie = 1
kitty = 3

if doggie < kitty
  puts "Whoa, that dog is fiesty!"
else 
  puts "The cats are still the kings of the jungle."
