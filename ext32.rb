#also we can go through mixed arrays too
for i in change

end

# we can also build arrays, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use a range object to do 0 to 5 counts
for i in (0..5)
  puts "Adding #{i} to the list."
 # push is a method that arrays understand. Append â€” Pushes the given object(s) on to the end of this array. This expression returns the array itself, so several appends may be chained together. See also #pop for the opposite effect.
 elements.push(i)
end

# now we can puts them out too
for i in elements
  puts "Element was: #{i}"

# Take a look at how you used the range (0..5). Look up the Range class to understand it.
# Could you have avoided that for-loop entirely on line 24 and just assigned (0..5) directly to elements?
# Find the Ruby documentation on arrays and read about them. What other operations can you do to arrays besides push?

# An environment variable is a link between our program and the outside world. An environment variable is essentially a label referring to a piece of text; and can be used to store configuration information such as paths, usernames, and so on. You can access operating system environment variables using the predefined variable ENV. ENV is simply a hash.
